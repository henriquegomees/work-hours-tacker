# Work hours tracker

## Introduction
This is a simple app for tracking working hours. You can log the time you arrive at the office, leave for lunch, etc.

## Server requirements
- PHP >=5.3.7

## Setting up
First clone this repo into your server:
```bash
	$ git clone https://github.com/henriquegomees/work-hours-tacker.git
```

Set up the `application/config/database.php` file. Make sure your database matches the settings in it.

> **Obs.:** Do not change the database name. 

Then proceed to the `script.sql` file and run all those scripts.
After that, you're probably good to go.
